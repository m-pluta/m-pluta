# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Michal, a Polish software engineer living in the UK, currently studying Computer Science at [Durham University](https://durham.ac.uk/).
I just finished my 2nd year of my Integrated Masters (MEng), and was fortunate to be selected for Arm's internship programme in summer 2024.

## Research Interests

I really love pushing software to its limits and making programs run as fast as possible which I believe is the pinnacle of computer engineering. As such my interests lie in
- High Performance/Throuhput Computing and its dependence on optimised compilers.
- Data Oriented Design and its methodical approach to choice of memory allocation.
- Solving NP-Hard problems using highly optimised algorithms, utilising academic papers and heuristics.

## About me

I love to learn new technologies and I'm always looking for new challenges. I love working as a team and really appreciate the value of good communication, even if that means getting roasted for horrible code. I can speak Polish and am currently learning Chinese. I love to boulder climb and play tennis in my free time.
