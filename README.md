# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Michal, a developer living in the UK currently studying Computer Science at the University of Durham.
I'm in my 2nd year of study and looking for a summer 2024 internship.

## About me

I love to learn new technologies and I'm always looking for new challenges. I love working as a team and really appreciate the value of good communication, even if that means getting roasted for horrible code. I can speak Polish and am currently learning Chinese. I love to boulder climb and play tennis in my free time.
